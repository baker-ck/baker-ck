👋 Hello, my name is Clayton

🌄 Cape Town native

📚 PhD student working on graph neural networks and machine learning for dynamic systems at University of the Western Cape

👨‍🏫 Lecturer in computer science at University of the Western Cape

📊 I teach Java Programming (COS101) and Data Structures and Algorithms (CSC211)

🔎 I have experience as an external reviewer for paper submissions to international conferences (AAAI and PanAfriconAI), workshops (CAKR) and journals (JAL)

⚽️ My goal is to promote and communicate the value of higher education in society through excellence in teaching, research and service

🏋️ In my free time you can find me getting coffee, strength training, reading and going on new adventures

💪 Leadership, empathy, communication, problem-solving, teamwork
